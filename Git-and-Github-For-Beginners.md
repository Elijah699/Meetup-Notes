After the Open-Source Software(OSS) session at the Open Source Community Africa (OSCA) meetup on Saturday, 5th February 2022, The workshop session for Git and Github For Beginners commenced with definitions of both key terms by attendant of the the meetup before formal definitions was given by the OSCA-Ado-Ekiti Lead Salawu Abdulmalik the anchor of the session.

We learned that Git is a free, open-source version control system software used for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among entities (developers, programmers or opensourcers as a whole) collaboratively developing source code during software development while Github is a provider of internet hosting service for Git repositories.


<h6>WHY IS GIT AND GITHUB IMPORTANT TO AN OPENSOURCER?</h6>
Git and Github are relevant tools an Opensourcer (a contributor to an open source project) must possess for ease of contribution to a project.


<h6>GUIDE ON MAKING CHANGES ON GIT AND GITHUB</h6>

When changes or a feature wants to be added to a project, it is advisable not to make those changes on the master/main branch. A new branch should be created for such purposes and a pull request can be created from the new branch of personal repository to the required branch of the original (upstream) repository.


<h6>PRACTICAL SESSION</h6>

We had the opportunity to practicalize the theoretical aspect of what we have learned. The exercise was to help attendant create their first pull request by adding names to the NAMES.md file in the OSCA-Ado-Ekiti/Members-Directory repository.
